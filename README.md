# University Management System (Java)

This project is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) exercise that illustrates several important concepts of OOP using a University Management System as an example.

## Project Description

This repository demonstrates the design and implementation of a simple management system for a university. It is built entirely in Java and serves as a learning tool for OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## Features

- Models for students, faculty, courses, departments, and administrative operations
- Demonstrates relationships between different university entities
- Example operations for managing and querying university data
- Focus on clean code and OOP best practices

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/haseebdoesdev/university-management-system-java.git
   cd university-management-system-java
   ```

2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans).

3. Build and run the project:
   - There is no additional setup required; simply run the main class (named appropriately for the entry point of the system).
   - Make sure you have Java installed (JDK 8 or higher is recommended).

## Usage

- All core classes and logic are implemented in Java.
- You can extend or modify the system to add more university features or enhance the OOP design patterns.
- Suitable for students and developers who want to understand OOP by example.
